## Project (16%)
- You are required to do a project at the end of the semester.
- Students will be divided into groups of 1-4 people (About 10 groups).
- You are required to either:
  - (1) choose (or be given) a specific OS/Topic for detailed survey and analysis (research project),
  - (2) implement a small part of the linux system, should not be trivial, should be interesting. (You can talk with me about any ideas you have)
- You need to figure out which option you are going to go with for the project before the deadline (Oct 29)
- Each group will write a 5-10 page report on the project you are doing.
- For option (1) you are required to do a presentation in th class (8-10 mins)
- For option (2) you are required to do a demo in the class (8-10 mins)
- I may change the time allocated for the each group depending on the size of the group.
- You need to attend to other groups presentations/demos.
- You need to ask questions about other groups projects.
- Evaluations will be based on the quality of the project, presentation, attendance, participation etc. Each member of a group will receive the same grade.
- Two groups cannot share the same topic.

### Example Ideas:
- Implementation details of a specific OS (ex: Kali Linux, Arch Linux, etc.) Note: If you choose a topic like this, you need to go in depth about how this operating system is different from others, and what are the implementation details of it--- how does this OS manages memeory, processes, devices, files, etc.
- Implementation of a specific algorithm that is used in OS. Ex: RSA, Diffie-Hellman algorithm, etc. (If you are choosing a topic like this, work on the implementation in a linux system)
- Specific topic in OS management like OS Sandboxing, Linux GFS implementation, Hypervisors and virtual machines, DDOS prevention in linux systems, deadlock prevention in linux system, etc.
- Implementation of a device driver for a embedded system.
- Arch Linux, Kali Linux, Barrelfish OS, DOS, MacOS, Kolibri OS, Bodhi Linux
- FAT32, NTFS, FAT File systems. (You can pick up 1 of these file systems)
- OS performance of RAID
- Remote Procedure Calls.
- The fairness in Processor Scheduling.
- Study of TLB performance.
